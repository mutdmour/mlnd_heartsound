* add to files as needed ## Remastered in Python - Mutasem Aldmour / email or github link
* module names shortened ex: bf.butterworth

* band pass filter instead of high and low pass filters? different types of filters? 
* test audio recording in seperate text file for testing reasons - or csv with results in other files or same file
* lpf_frequency for envelope in settings
